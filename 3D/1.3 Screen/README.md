This is some CAD files for the 1.3" screen insted of the 0.96" one.

# Note:
You need to cut off one side where you put in the actual screen to fit it in

I haven't had time to fix this but feel free to DIY!

The 1.3" screen seems like it not SSD and so has a white line on the left and some letters can be consmed by the left side like [this](https://i.imgur.com/5XdflrQ.jpg) so I've added a language.h filt that *kinda* works but still kinda jank.
